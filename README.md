Craftus Reskined is a modified version of Craftus Reloaded : https://github.com/RSDuck/craftus_reloaded with Minecraft 1.16 textures.

This idea is not mine, it is from user https://github.com/duffparis 
Why I made this? Because duffparis repository isn't available anymore and because some people prefer the OG Minecraft textures (like me!).

Only .cia version is available until now, but I will make .3dsx version soon.
