Craftus Reskined is a modified version of Craftus Reloaded : https://github.com/RSDuck/craftus_reloaded with Minecraft 1.16 textures.

This idea is not mine, it is from user https://github.com/duffparis 
Why I made this? Because duffparis repository isn't available anymore and because some people prefer the OG Minecraft textures (like me!).

After launching it for the first time, you can change the controls in sd:/craftus/options.ini.
