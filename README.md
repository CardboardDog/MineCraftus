You may know me for my previous name GamesSanti or for my modification on Craftus Reloaded. I did this to learn more about programming and to have some fun, the idea was stolen from @duffparis, which posted some years ago a modified version of his to reddit, as nothing was published, I made it myself. 
Tried to get in contact with duff, had no success but, he follows me on github now so I least know that he ain’t dead. @cooolgamer also hopped in this project to help me but nothing much was done, also, but he is still a cool person, go check his other stuff.
Anyways, I’ve stopped doing this because I didn’t find it enjoyable anymore, if you want to do anything with this, go all on out, I wont touch this project anymore.
